## Heap Introduction

- The heap this is a region that is used to allocate memory at runtime.
- The following are the core functions that are used from `stdlib.h` headers in c
and they are functions.

1. malloc():
	* prototype `void malloc(size_t)`
	* This is a function that takes the size to be allocated as the argument and 
	returns a pointer to the allocated memory on the heap.
	* The function returns a void pointer therefore typecasting is encouraged =).
	
2. free():
	* prototype `void free(* ptr)`
	* This is a function that takes the pointer returned by malloc as the argument
	and frees or releases that region of memory.
	* The function returns _NULL_


### Defination of basic terms

* __program break/brk__: This is a pointer that points to the end of the heap segment
* **end_data**: This is a pointer that points to the end of the data segment
* **start_brk** : This is a pointer that points to the start of the heap segment.

* Allocators:
	- These are algorithms that interact with the kernel via syscalls to allocate memory.
	- Some of the different allocators include *pt_malloc* etc..

* syscalls include 
	1. brk() syscall:
		- This is a pointer that is used to initizalid the heap segment
		- This is done by initializing the `end_data && start_brk = brk`
	2. sbrk() syscall: 
		- This is syscall that is used to increment the brk pointer
		- This syscall called with an argument of (0) can be used to return the
		current position of the program break pointer.


*When __malloc()__ is called it allocates the size passed in the argument plus the size of the chunk's __metadata__.
The size passed to malloc must lie in the boundary of 0x10 bytes in 64-bit systems*
